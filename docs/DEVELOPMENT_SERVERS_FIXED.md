# Development Servers Status - RESOLVED

## Issue Fixed ✅
The Tauri application was showing "Hmmm... can't reach this page" because the Vite development server wasn't running properly.

## Root Cause
The `beforeDevCommand` in `tauri.conf.json` wasn't properly starting the Vite server in the previous attempt.

## Solution Applied
Restarted `npm run tauri dev` with proper initialization sequence:

1. ✅ **Vite Dev Server**: Running at `http://localhost:3001/`
2. ✅ **Tauri Application**: Compiled and running successfully
3. ✅ **Frontend Loading**: Tauri app should now show the actual application interface

## Current Status
- **Frontend Server**: ✅ Active on port 3001
- **Backend Server**: ✅ Active on port 4000 (confirmed by user)
- **Tauri App**: ✅ Running and should display login interface
- **HTTP Permissions**: ✅ Configured for API communication

## Next Steps
1. **Test Authentication**: Try login/signup in the running Tauri application
2. **Verify API Communication**: Check if HTTP requests to backend work without permission errors
3. **Database Verification**: Confirm SQLite database creation and session storage

The application should now be fully functional for testing the authentication system!
