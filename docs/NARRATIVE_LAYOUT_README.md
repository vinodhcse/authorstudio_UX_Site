# Narrative Layout Implementation

## Overview
The Narrative Layout is a comprehensive hierarchical story planning system built with ReactFlow, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. It allows authors to visually organize their story structure from outline to individual scenes, with support for character arcs, location arcs, object arcs, and lore arcs.

## Features

### üéØ Hierarchical Story Structure
- **Outline** ‚Üí **Acts** ‚Üí **Chapters** ‚Üí **Scenes** ‚Üí **Character/Location/Object/Lore Arcs**
- Visual tree representation with expand/collapse functionality
- Automatic layout positioning and edge generation

### üé® Node Types
1. **Outline Node** (Purple) - Main story structure
2. **Act Node** (Blue) - Story acts with goals
3. **Chapter Node** (Green) - Individual chapters
4. **Scene Node** (Orange) - Specific scenes with character/location data
5. **Character Arc Node** (Pink) - Character development arcs
6. **Location Arc Node** (Cyan) - Location significance tracking
7. **Object Arc Node** (Amber) - Important object tracking
8. **Lore Arc Node** (Indigo) - Lore element connections

### ü§ñ AI Integration
- **Emotional Arc Analysis** - Detects tone and intensity in scenes
- **Pacing Analysis** - Identifies pacing speed and confidence
- **Smart Suggestions** - Character balance, plot holes, lore connections
- **Real-time Feedback** - Floating suggestion panels with quick actions

### ‚ö° Interactive Features
- **Expand/Collapse** - Hierarchical view control
- **Drag & Connect** - Create relationships between nodes
- **Quick Create** - Toolbar shortcuts for different node types
- **Search & Filter** - Filter by characters, locations, status, etc.
- **Dual View Modes** - Board view (ReactFlow) and List view

### üéõÔ∏è Controls & Navigation
- **ReactFlow Controls** - Zoom, pan, fit view
- **Minimap** - Quick navigation for large narratives
- **Background Grid** - Visual guidance
- **Animated Edges** - Smooth bezier curves for connections

## File Structure

```

```

## Usage

### Basic Node Structure
```typescript
interface NarrativeNode {
  id: string;
  type: 'outline' | 'act' | 'chapter' | 'scene' | 'character-arc' | 'location-arc' | 'object-arc' | 'lore-arc';
  status: 'not-completed' | 'in-progress' | 'completed';
  position: { x: number; y: number };
  parentId: string | null;
  childIds: string[];
  linkedNodeIds: string[];
  data: NodeTypeSpecificData;
}
```

### Creating New Nodes
- Use the **Quick Create** toolbar for instant node creation
- Click **"Add Scene"** for a general scene node
- Drag from node handles to create connections
- Click empty canvas space when dragging to open creation modal

### AI Suggestions
The system provides intelligent suggestions for:
- **Character Balance** - Detect missing characters in story sections
- **Pacing Anomalies** - Identify inconsistent story rhythm
- **Lore Connections** - Suggest relevant lore integrations
- **Plot Consistency** - Flag potential plot holes

### Filtering & Search
- **Text Search** - Search node titles and descriptions
- **Status Filter** - Filter by completion status
- **Character Filter** - Show nodes containing specific characters
- **Location Filter** - Filter by story locations
- **Node Type Filter** - Focus on specific narrative elements

## Key Benefits

1. **Visual Story Planning** - See your entire narrative structure at a glance
2. **Hierarchical Organization** - Maintain story structure from macro to micro levels
3. **AI-Powered Insights** - Get intelligent suggestions for story improvement
4. **Flexible Connections** - Link related narrative elements across the hierarchy
5. **Real-time Editing** - Edit nodes inline with immediate visual feedback
6. **Responsive Design** - Works on different screen sizes with smooth animations

## Sample Data
The implementation includes sample narrative data featuring:
- Epic fantasy setting with characters like Nemar, Garius, Elissa
- Multi-act structure with chapters and scenes
- Character arc tracking
- AI analysis examples with emotional tone and pacing data

## Future Enhancements
- Timeline integration for chronological story events
- Advanced AI analysis for plot structure optimization
- Collaborative editing with real-time synchronization
- Export capabilities for different story formats
- Integration with writing tools and manuscript generation

This implementation transforms the simple plot board into a comprehensive narrative planning system that supports complex story development workflows.
