   - ✅ Secure random string generation
   - ✅ Web Crypto API validation

6. **Secure Storage System (Task A4 preparation)**
   - ✅ Encrypted session storage
   - ✅ Device keypair management
   - ✅ Subscription validation logic
   - ✅ Platform-agnostic storage interface

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `src/lib/cryptoUtils.ts` - Crypto utilities for encryption
- `src/lib/secureStorage.ts` - Secure storage management

### Modified Files:
- `src/lib/apiClient.ts` - Enhanced with Tauri support and better JWT handling
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Updated for async operations
- `src/pages/BookForge/components/EditorHeader.tsx` - Fixed logout functionality

## 🔧 Key Technical Improvements

### ApiClient Class Enhancements:
```typescript
class ApiClient {
  - Enhanced JWT header management
  - Tauri file system integration
  - Automatic token refresh
  - Better error handling
  - Async device ID generation
  - Network status awareness
}
```

### Security Features:
```typescript
- AES-GCM encryption with 256-bit keys
- PBKDF2 key derivation (200k iterations)
- RSA-2048 device keypairs
- Secure random generation
- Platform-specific storage
```

### Tauri Integration:
```typescript
- Cross-platform storage abstraction
- File-based secure storage
- Environment detection
- Graceful fallbacks
```

## 🧪 Testing

### How to Test:
1. **Web Environment**: `npm run dev` → http://localhost:3001
2. **Tauri Environment**: `npm run tauri dev`

### Authentication Flow:
1. Navigate to login page
2. Enter credentials  
3. System stores tokens securely
4. Navigate to editor page
5. Test logout functionality

## 🚀 Next Steps (Remaining PRD Tasks)

### Task A2: useAuthStore (Zustand)
- [ ] Implement Zustand store for auth state
- [ ] Add offline unlock functionality
- [ ] Subscription refresh logic

### Task B1-B4: Device Keys & Session Handling
- [ ] First-time login flow with device keypair
- [ ] LocalSession creation and management
- [ ] Subscription TTL + grace logic

### Task C1-C4: UI Integration
- [ ] AuthGate wrapper component
- [ ] UnlockOffline screen
- [ ] Offline mode banner
- [ ] Auto token refresh UI

## 📋 Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables:
```bash
# .env file
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
```

### Package Dependencies Added:
```json
{
  "@tauri-apps/api": "^2.7.0",
  "@tauri-apps/plugin-fs": "^2.4.1"
}
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- All sensitive data encrypted with user-derived keys
- No plaintext passwords stored locally
- Platform-specific secure storage when available
- Proper key derivation with sufficient iterations
- Device-specific keypairs for enhanced security
- Graceful degradation for unsupported environments

---

**Status**: Task A1 is fully implemented and ready for testing. The foundation is laid for implementing the remaining authentication tasks (A2-E3) as outlined in the PRD.





Excellent! All errors are resolved. Let me create a summary of what I've accomplished:

✅ Chapter Architecture Integration Complete
I have successfully integrated the new chapter-based architecture into the BookForge Writing mode, replacing the mock data with real chapter management. Here's what was implemented:

🔧 Core Changes Made:
Editor.tsx Integration:

✅ Removed mock chapterContent import
✅ Added useChapters hook integration
✅ Implemented chapter loading and management logic
✅ Added auto-save functionality with 2-second debouncing
✅ Integrated CreateChapterPage for empty state
✅ Added content synchronization when current chapter changes
EditorHeader.tsx Enhancement:

✅ Updated to accept real chapters[] prop
✅ Replaced mock chapter structure with real data grouping
✅ Chapters now grouped by Act using linkedAct or position fallback
✅ Dynamic chapter display based on actual book data
BookForgePage.tsx Updates:

✅ Added useChapters hook to load chapter data
✅ Passed chapters data to EditorHeader component
🏗️ Architecture Overview:
Data Flow:

Chapter Management:

Empty State: Shows CreateChapterPage when no chapters exist
Content Loading: Real chapter content replaces mock data
Auto-Save: Debounced saves every 2 seconds using saveChapterContent
Chapter Navigation: EditorHeader displays real chapters grouped by Acts
🎯 Key Features Implemented:
Real Chapter Loading: No more mock data - chapters load from actual API
Auto-Save System: Content changes are debounced and saved automatically
Empty State Handling: Proper UI for when no chapters exist yet
Act Grouping: Chapters organized by Acts in header navigation
Content Synchronization: Editor content updates when switching chapters
🔄 What Works Now:
✅ Writing mode loads real chapters from BookContext
✅ Shows CreateChapterPage when book has no chapters
✅ Auto-saves chapter content with debouncing
✅ EditorHeader displays real chapter structure grouped by Acts
✅ Seamless integration with existing TipTap editor
✅ Proper error handling and TypeScript compliance
The Writing mode is now fully integrated with the real chapter architecture! The system moves away from mock data to use the comprehensive chapter management system with revision tracking, auto-save, and proper plot structure integration.

Next Steps Available:

Update Planning mode to use real chapter data
Implement revision history UI
Add collaborative editing features
Enhance chapter creation with plot structure assignment
Would you like me to continue with Planning mode integration or focus on any specific aspect of the chapter management system?
